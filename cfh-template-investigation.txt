When loading the original test .dotx it *is* possible to reuse the template header/footer definitions.

When running my custom test it *is not* possible to reuse header/footer definitions.
 - I don't know why, maybe because I used the built-in Word themes?
 - with my customisation it's possible to pass 'EMPTY' and have it fall-back to the default header/footer.
 - but, the `first`, `default`, `even` combinations are not working as expected
   - it only uses `first` and `even` and doesn't seem to use the default header for the left-hand page
     (I haven't looked at the generated content for that scenario yet).

 - TODO: Try using just a plain header template instead of the theme
 - Compare the original template file against my attempt (it did help me discover some issues with my first attempt)
